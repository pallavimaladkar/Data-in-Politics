POLI 281 Final Project

In this final, my classmates and I used R to analyze political data. We aimed to study the relationship between regime type and corruption level of various states over decades, and displayed this relationship in a number of ways. We also considered and attempted to control for potential confounding variables in our regressions and models, like GDP and education level.
